# Add-Free YouTube (FreeTube API Example)

This project demonstrates how to use the FreeTube API to search and watch YouTube videos without ads or tracking, using simple HTML pages.

## Files

- `index2.html`: Search for YouTube videos using the FreeTube API. Results link to the video page.
- `wach2.html`: Watch a selected video by loading its details from the FreeTube API.
- `index.html` and `wach.html`: (Original files, not using FreeTube API)

## How it Works

1. Open `index2.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a search query and submit.
3. Click a video title to open `wach2.html` and watch the video.

## API Reference
- [FreeTube API](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube)

## Notes
- This is a demo and may require a working FreeTube API endpoint.
- For privacy and ad-free viewing.
